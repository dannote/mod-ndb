EXAMPLE 1: SESSION DATA FOR A WEB APPLICATION.

The "session" table holds name/value information associated
with an integer session key.

LOADING THE DATA

The SQL script load_sessions.sql will create the mod_ndb_test database, 
create the session table, and load the data.  To load the full example:

  mysql < load_sessions.sql
  gunzip load_icons.sql.gz
  mysql mod_ndb_test < load_icons.sql


COFIGURING THE SERVER

The file ex1_httpd.conf should be included in an httpd.conf file,
e.g. "Include /path/to/mod_ndb/example1/ex1_httpd.conf"


RUNNING THE TEST SUITE

The files beginning with "t" form a test suite.  These tests require the 
"curl" binary.

First, look at base.test, in case you need to edit the hostname or port number 
there. Then run the tests individually.

Test t1 selects all the data from session 3.
Test t2 modifies a row of data in session 3.
Test t3 repeats test t1; note the modified row.
Test t4 inserts a new row of session data.
Test t5 demonstrates the use of the ndb_select_all utility and shows the row 
  created by t3.
Test t6 deletes the row created in test t4.
Test t7 repeats test t5; note the deleted row.
