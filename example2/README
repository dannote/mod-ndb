EXAMPLE 1: ICONS, BLOBS, AND RAW OUTPUT

Example2 illustrates a "user_icon" table that might be used in a social 
networking application.  JPEG images are stored in the table as BLOBs; 
you can retreive them from mod_ndb using the "raw" output format.

To load the table, uncompress the load_icons.sql.gz file and pipe it in
to a mysql client, like this:

 gzcat load_icons.sql.gz | mysql -u root 

There are no included test scripts here, but you should be able to view 
the JPEG images from a browser.   

For example, the icon for { user_id=3, icon_id=1 } will be visible at the URL
  
   /ndb/ex/2/icon/3/1

The complete list of valid URLs is:

/ndb/ex/2/icon/1/1
/ndb/ex/2/icon/1/2
/ndb/ex/2/icon/2/1
/ndb/ex/2/icon/3/1
/ndb/ex/2/icon/1/2
